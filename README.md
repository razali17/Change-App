# The Change Collective

An application designed for those who want to make a change in the world! This application connects to your bank account using [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) and collects the round-ups from your transactions. The roundups are then added to a collective fund which gets donated to charities based on the votes of the collective. Use YOUR change to make a change!


## Starting the Application

You need **TWO** terminals for this.

In one terminal, run `bundle` in the root directory of the app to install the dependencies. Run `bin/rake db:setup` to create the databases (called rails_project_development by default). Run `bin/rails s` to run the server.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `client`. Run `npm install`. Then run `npm start` and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

NOTE: You need at least Ruby~ 2.6.2 in order to run bundle. Please update your RVM first!
